            <h2>A Formal Declaration on the Non-Negotiable Sanctity of Cameron's Couch</h2>
            
            <div class="declaration-content">
                <p>Let it be hereby stated, for the benefit of guests, acquaintances, and even overly comfortable plus-ones who believe the living room is a free-for-all: Cameron's couch is not, and shall never be, a venue for public or private displays of affection. This is not up for debate. This is not a "vibe check." This is law.</p>
                
                <p>Before proceeding further, it is essential to acknowledge the storied history of this particular couch. It has since borne witness to countless solitary evenings, intense snack marathons, and strategic pillow placements that defy the laws of physics. The couch's fabric, worn yet resilient, tells a tale of unwavering loyalty and steadfast support, earning it a venerable status that transcends mere seating. This legacy of service commands that its sanctity be preserved with the utmost vigilance and respect.</p>
                
                <p>To understand the gravity of this declaration, one must first acknowledge a few foundational truths:</p>
                
                <ol class="foundational-truths">
                    <li>The couch is Cameron's.</li>
                    <li>Cameron is not interested in your cuddles.</li>
                    <li>Ergo, the couch must remain untainted by acts of interpersonal warmth.</li>
                </ol>
                
                <p>This prohibition includes, but is not limited to: snuggling, nuzzling, smooching, caressing, and any form of affection that could be described in Victorian literature as "a moment of tender proximity." This includes forehead kisses, shared blankets, lingering glances, and most certainly anything that requires repositioning throw pillows for "better neck support."</p>
                
                <p>Lest anyone misunderstand, this is not an attack on romance. But Cameron's couch is Switzerland: neutral, untouched, and aggressively uninterested in becoming the site of your adorable displays of affection. It is a demilitarized zone in the war between comfort and co-dependence.</p>
                
                <p>The upholstery has not consented to bear witness to your whispered sweet nothings. The armrest is not your date night confidant. The center cushion is not a metaphor for emotional intimacy.</p>
                
                <p>It is a couch. A highly specific couch. And as such, it is to be used only for the following activities:</p>
                
                <ul class="approved-activities">
                    <li>Sitting with an appropriate degree of formality.</li>
                    <li>Watching television in a manner that does not involve shared blankets.</li>
                    <li>Quiet reflection (preferably with arms crossed or hands folded like a Victorian ghost).</li>
                    <li>Eating snacks like an adult.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>Violators of this decree shall be met with swift but nonviolent judgment: raised eyebrows, pointed silences, and potentially, the relocation of their person to a secondary, emotionally expendable chair.</p>
                
                <p>Let us all honor this most hallowed of household fixtures. May we sit upright, may we keep our affections confined to designated zones, and may we never—never—assume that Cameron's couch is just "a place to chill."</p>
                
                <p class="final-statement"><strong>It is not.</strong></p>
                <p class="final-statement"><strong>And it must remain unsullied.</strong></p>
